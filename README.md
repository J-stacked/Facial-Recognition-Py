Facial recognition project with Python and face_recognition (https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/tree/master)

Please install dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Project is capable of encoding images in training/ and generating output file in output/.  

Once that is complete, you may run any image in validation/ (or any other location!) through the recognize_faces function.  

This program also supports command line arguments.  Run program with --help or -h as shown below for help with that.

Image encoding capable of running with CPU and GPU.  Default is CPU integrated graphics (model = "hog"), but the GPU may be chosen as well (model = "cnn").  GPU offers more accurate encoding than the CPU, but is generally slower (as shown below).
